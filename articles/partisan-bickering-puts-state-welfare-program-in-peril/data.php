<p><strong>LANSING</strong> – Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked in the debate over the future of the state welfare program, and the state will not have the money to continue the current program if an agreement has not been reached by March 1st.</p>

<p>“Because politicians can’t come to an agreement, my son and I may not have food next month,” says Wendy Brown. Brown is a' . $race1 . ' woman in her early 30s with a high school degree and has been receiving aid from the Family Independence Program (FIP) for the past year to help support herself and her three-year-old son.</p>

<p>Brown went on to say that she has been following the ongoing debates closely. “This is something that is going to affect me and my community,” Brown says, “A lot of people I know will be paying attention.” Brown, who lives in a predominantly ' . $race . ' neighborhood outside of Grand Rapids, believes that her friends and neighbors have a lot to lose if the parties cannot reach an agreement.</p>

<p>FIP is the cash assistance provided to families living below the poverty line. Along with food stamps and Medicaid, FIP comprises the central tier of the welfare program for the state of Michigan, and it is where Democrats and Republicans disagree most vehemently. While the legislature does not seem close to passing a bill, it appears as though every part of the program is up for negotiation. Some of the proposed changes to FIP would: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>	Put time limits on how long able-bodied recipients can receive benefits</p></li>
<li><p>	Provide additional compensation for families with a large number of children</p></li>
<li><p>	Implement work requirements and drug testing in order to receive benefits</p></li>
<li><p>	Double the number of social workers in the state</p></li>
<li><p>	Allow faith-based organizations to receive funds in order to provide job training</p></li>
<li><p>	Increase the number of job-training programs available</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The latest overhaul proposal, by Representative Paul Koretz, is called the Comprehensive Assistance Plan. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has not formally taken a stance on the proposal, but he has made clear their priority to get substantive welfare reform passed quickly.</p>
