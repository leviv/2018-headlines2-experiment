<p>Powell, the nation\'s top economic policymaker who was recently confirmed by the Senate, discussed Wall Street regulations in a hearing last week.</p>

<p>Both Republicans and Democrats questioned Powell over his plans for regulating Wall Street. Trump and many Republicans campaigned on rolling back regulations on banks, rules that they say are too strict. But Democrats worry that watering down the rules put in place after the 2008-09 financial crisis would trigger another taxpayer bailout of the financial sector.</p>

<p>During the debate, Senators Orrin Hatch (R – UT) and Sherrod Brown (D – OH) did not agree on how to move forward. Sen. Brown stated Sen. Hatch was “losing focus” and ignoring tough regulations.</p>

<p>Sen. Hatch responded, “The problem of too many regulations is on the agenda. You guys know we will get to it soon.” No agreement came out of the discussion.</p>

<p>“Honestly, senator, I think they are tough enough,” Powell said when Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) pressed him on whether he would like to see any regulations on banks strengthened.</p>

<p>“Politicians in Washington are ignoring this issue,” Warren responded.</p>

<p>Powell, who has a reputation in Washington as a consensus builder, has tried to walk a careful line of supporting many of the regulations put in place on banks after the Great Recession, while also signaling his willingness to make the paperwork “more efficient,” especially for smaller banks.</p>

<p>“I do not characterize what we’re doing as deregulation,” Powell said. “I would characterize it as looking back over eight years of innovative regulation and making sure what we did makes sense.”</p>

<p>Powell was originally nominated to the Fed board by President Barack Obama in 2012, and was confirmed as Fed Chair this January. He is expected to address Wall Street regulations before March.</p>';
